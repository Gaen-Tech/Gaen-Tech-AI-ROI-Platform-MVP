# Gaen Tech Platform - User Guide

Welcome to the Gaen Tech AI ROI Generation Platform! This guide will walk you through the entire process of finding, analyzing, and qualifying leads to help you close more deals, faster.

## 1. Introduction

This platform is your AI-powered assistant for business development. It helps you:
- **Discover** new opportunities by analyzing any company's website.
- **Analyze** their digital presence to find concrete, high-value opportunities.
- **Qualify** them as leads based on data-driven insights.
- **Generate** a professional proposal in a single click.

## 2. Platform Setup

Before you begin, ensure the application is properly configured with a Google Gemini API key. Without a valid API key set as an environment variable, the AI analysis features will not work, and you will see an error message.

## 3. Navigating the Platform

The main navigation is on the left-hand **Sidebar**. There are three key sections:

- **Dashboard**: Your mission control center for a high-level overview.
- **Discovery**: Where you find and analyze new companies.
- **Leads**: Where you manage the companies you've analyzed.

## 4. The Workflow: From Discovery to Proposal

This is the core workflow you will follow to generate and manage leads.

### Step 1: Discover and Analyze a Company

Navigate to the **Discovery** page.

1. Find a company you're interested in.
2. In the "Analyze New Company by URL" section, type or paste their website URL (e.g., `innovatesolutions.com`).
3. Click the **"Analyze URL"** button.
4. The AI will now analyze the website in real-time. This may take 15-30 seconds. You will see a loading indicator.

Once the analysis is complete, you will be automatically redirected to the **Leads** page, where your newly analyzed company will appear at the top of the list.

### Step 2: Manage Your Leads

Navigate to the **Leads** page. This is your pipeline.

**A) Filtering Your Leads:**
- At the top right, you will find two filters that work together:
    - **Status**: Filter by the lead's current stage (e.g., show only "Qualified" leads).
    - **Minimum ROI**: Filter by the lead's financial potential (e.g., show leads worth over "$100k+").
- Use these to focus on your highest-priority leads.

**B) Viewing Lead Details:**
1. For any lead in the list, click the **"View"** button.
2. A modal window will pop up, showing you a detailed breakdown of the AI analysis:
    - **AI Opportunity Score**: A quick measure of the lead's potential. Higher is better.
    - **Est. Total Annual ROI**: The total potential financial gain for the client.
    - **Key Opportunities**: Specific problems the company likely faces and how Gaen Tech's AI solutions can solve them.
    - **Analysis Sources**: A list of clickable links to the web pages the AI used for its analysis. **Use these to verify the data and build your own understanding before a client call.**

**C) Updating Lead Status:**
- In the "Status" column for each lead, you can use the dropdown menu to update their stage in the sales funnel:
    - **Prospected**: The default status for a new lead.
    - **Contacted**: You have reached out to the lead.
    - **Qualified**: You have confirmed they are a good fit.
    - **Closed**: The deal is won or lost.

### Step 3: Export a Professional Proposal

The final step is to generate a client-ready document.

1.  From the **Lead Detail Modal** (see Step 2B), click the **"Export as PDF"** button.
2.  A professionally formatted PDF proposal will be generated and downloaded to your computer.
3.  This document contains all the key information from the analysis and is ready to be sent to the prospective client to start the conversation.

## 5. Understanding the Dashboard

The **Dashboard** gives you a real-time overview of your efforts.

- **Stat Cards**: At the top, you'll see key metrics: Total Opportunities analyzed, number of Qualified Leads, and the Total Potential ROI across all your leads.
- **Leads by Status**: This pie chart shows you the distribution of your leads across the sales funnel.
- **Potential ROI by Industry**: This bar chart shows which industries hold the most financial potential, helping you focus your efforts.

This data helps you track your progress and identify trends in your lead generation activities.
