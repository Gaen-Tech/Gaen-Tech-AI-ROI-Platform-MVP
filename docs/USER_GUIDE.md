## 3. The Workflow: From Discovery to Proposal

This is the core workflow you will follow to generate and manage leads.

### Step 1: Discover and Analyze a Company

Navigate to the **Discovery** page. You have two ways to analyze a company:

**A) Analyze a New Company by URL:**
1. Find a company you're interested in.
2. In the "Analyze New Company by URL" section, type or paste their website URL (e.g., `innovatesolutions.com`).
3. Click the **"Analyze URL"** button.
4. The AI will now analyze the website in real-time. This may take 15-30 seconds. You will see a loading indicator.

**B) Analyze from the Existing List:**
1. Use the search bar or the industry filter to find a company in the main list.
2. Once you find a target, click the **"Analyze Company"** button in its row.

Once the analysis is complete, you will be automatically redirected to the **Leads** page, where your newly analyzed company will appear at the top of the list.

### Step 2: Manage Your Leads

Navigate to the **Leads** page. This is your pipeline.

**A) Viewing Lead Details:**
1. For any lead in the list, click the **"View"** button.
2. A modal window will pop up, showing you a detailed breakdown of the AI analysis:
    - **AI Opportunity Score**: A quick measure of the lead's potential. Higher is better.
    - **Est. Total Annual ROI**: The total potential financial gain for the client.
    - **Key Opportunities**: Specific problems the company likely faces and how Gaen Tech's AI solutions can solve them, including individual impact estimates.
    - **Analysis Sources**: A list of clickable links to the web pages the AI used for its analysis. **Use these to verify the data and build your own understanding before a client call.**

**B) Updating Lead Status:**
- In the "Status" column for each lead, you can use the dropdown menu to update their stage in the sales funnel:
    - **Prospected**: The default status for a new lead.
    - **Contacted**: You have reached out to the lead.
    - **Qualified**: You have confirmed they are a good fit.
    - **Closed**: The deal is won or lost.

### Step 3: Export a Professional Proposal

The final step is to generate a client-ready document.

1.  From the **Lead Detail Modal** (see Step 2A), click the **"Export as PDF"** button.
2.  A professionally formatted PDF proposal will be generated and downloaded to your computer.
3.  This document contains all the key information from the analysis and is ready to be sent to the prospective client to start the conversation.

## 4. Understanding the Dashboard

The **Dashboard** gives you a real-time overview of your efforts.

- **Leads by Status**: This pie chart shows you the distribution of your leads across the sales funnel.
- **Potential ROI by Industry**: This bar chart shows which industries hold the most financial potential, helping you focus your efforts.

This data helps you track your progress and identify trends in your lead generation activities.
