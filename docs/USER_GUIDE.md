# Gaen Tech Platform - User Guide

Welcome to the Gaen Tech AI ROI Generation Platform! This guide will walk you through the entire process of finding, analyzing, and qualifying leads to help you close more deals, faster.

## 1. Introduction

This platform is your AI-powered assistant for business development. It helps you:
- **Discover** new opportunities by analyzing any company's website.
- **Analyze** their digital presence using specialized AI "personas" to find concrete, high-value opportunities.
- **Qualify** them as leads based on data-driven insights.
- **Generate** a professional proposal in a single click.

## 2. Platform Setup

Before you begin, ensure the application is properly configured with a Google Gemini API key. Without a valid API key set as an environment variable, the AI analysis features will not work, and you will see an error message.

## 3. Navigating the Platform

The platform features a modern, responsive navigation system.

- **On Desktop**: A fixed **Sidebar** on the left provides constant access to the main views.
- **On Mobile**: A clean header with a "hamburger" menu icon toggles a slide-in navigation overlay.

There are four key sections:

- **Dashboard**: Your mission control center for a high-level overview and persona selection.
- **Discovery**: Where you find and analyze new companies.
- **Leads**: Where you manage the companies you've analyzed.
- **Configuration**: Where you manage your AI analysis personas.

## 4. The AI Persona System (Crucial!)

This platform is powered by a versatile AI that can adopt different "personas" to perform specialized analysis. This is the key to generating highly relevant insights.

### A) Selecting the Active Persona

Before you start analyzing, you need to tell the AI which role to play.

1.  Navigate to the **Dashboard**.
2.  Find the **"Analysis Configuration"** card.
3.  Use the **"Active Persona"** dropdown to select the persona you want to use for your next analysis.
    -   **General Business Analysis**: A great all-purpose analyst for common business problems.
    -   **AI Digital Transformation**: A specialist that looks for AI & automation opportunities.
    -   **Millennium Dental**: A hyper-specialized persona for a specific product.
    -   Any custom personas you create will also appear here.
4.  Your selection is saved automatically and will be used for all analyses until you change it again.

### B) Managing Personas on the Configuration Page

Navigate to the **Configuration** page to take full control over your AI personas.

1.  **View All Personas**: The page lists all available personas, separated into "Built-in" (read-only) and "Custom" (editable).
2.  **Create a New Persona**: Click the **"Create New Persona"** button. This gives you a blank slate to define a new AI role, including its name, description, and the critical **System Prompt** that tells it how to behave.
3.  **Clone a Persona**: The best way to create a new persona is to start from an existing one. Click the **"Clone"** button on any built-in persona. This creates an editable copy in your custom list, which you can then modify.
4.  **Edit & Delete**: For any custom persona, you can use the **"Edit"** button to change its properties or the **"Delete"** button to permanently remove it.

## 5. The Workflow: From Discovery to Proposal

This is the core workflow you will follow to generate and manage leads.

### Step 1: Discover and Analyze a Company

Navigate to the **Discovery** page.

1.  Make sure you have the correct persona selected on the Dashboard.
2.  In the input field, type or paste a company's website URL (e.g., `innovatesolutions.com`).
3.  Click the **"Start AI Analysis"** button.
4.  The AI will now analyze the website in real-time using the active persona. This may take 15-30 seconds.

Once the analysis is complete, you will be automatically redirected to the **Leads** page, where your new lead will appear at the top of the list.

### Step 2: Manage Your Leads

Navigate to the **Leads** page. This is your pipeline.

**A) Filtering and Sorting:**
- Use the controls at the top to search, filter by status (`Prospected`, `Qualified`, `Unqualified`), or sort your leads.

**B) Viewing Lead Details:**
1.  Click the **"Details"** button on any lead card.
2.  A modal will pop up with a detailed breakdown of the analysis, including the Opportunity Score, ROI, key opportunities, and the verifiable sources the AI used. For specialized personas, you may see extra data like "Practice Type" or "Referral Potential".

**C) Updating Lead Status:**
- Use the status dropdown on each lead card to move them through your sales funnel.

### Step 3: Export a Professional Proposal

1.  On any lead card, click the **"Export PDF"** button.
2.  A professionally formatted PDF proposal, tailored with the analysis data, will be generated and downloaded.
